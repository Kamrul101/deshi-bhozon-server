      "description": "This classic Indian dish is made with succulent chicken pieces cooked in a creamy tomato-based sauce, flavored with aromatic spices such as cumin, coriander, and garam masala. Served with fluffy basmati rice or hot naan bread, this dish is perfect for a hearty and flavorful meal. Butter chicken, also called Murgh Makhani, consists of bite-sized pieces of succulent boneless chicken thigh simmered in a creamy and super flavourful spiced tomato and cream sauce. It has a perfect balance of spicy and sweet, but is definitely mild on the spice spectrum of Indian curries. Even the littlest kids love this yummy sauce with its warm, cozy spices and chunks of tender chicken. ",
